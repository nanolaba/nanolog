# Nanolaba logger (Nanolog)

**Nanolog** â€” is a simple but powerful logger for Java applications, compatible with **SLF4J**,
that *removes the need for static logger instances* in every class requiring logging.

## Overview

**Nanolog** provides an advanced API for application logging, offering additional features not found
in other popular logger implementations:

1. Automatic caller class detection
2. Lazy message initialization via Supplier
3. Parameterized message support
4. Safe object-to-string conversion
5. Easy creation of custom logger implementations

**Nanolog** is an extremely lightweight library and can be used as a standalone logger. However, it also
supports integration with **SLF4J**, enabling compatibility with other logging libraries that act as its
bridges â€” such as **Logback**, **Log4j**, **JBoss Logging**, and others.

The latest stable version of the program is **1.0**.
